					<h4>The sales pitch</h4>
					</center>
					<span>
					<p>While we settle in for 2022, just the other week Christmas was celebrated. On its lead-up, it was common to hear the usual Christmas script being completed by everyone around. It was like a chorus the echoed in every house, shop, and workplace across the country: 
					<p2>“What do you hope Santa will bring you for Christmas?”</p2></p></span>
					
					<span><p><p2>“I’m not sure”, “I haven’t thought about it”</p2> and <p2>“I don’t need anything”</p2> are all socially acceptable answers.</p></span>
					<p>The patter is as old as Santa Clause himself.</p>
					
					<p>Every year is much the same.</p>
					
					<span><p><p2>‘38% of US consumers say that guessing what people want is their greatest annoyance when shopping for presents’</p2> (Emarsys 2021). This is only surprising as I would have guessed the figure to be more. Such is the issue with the gift giving roulette, that Australian retailer Myer created an entire 2021 advertisement campaign surrounding it. Titled Unriddle Christmas, Myer (2021) explores the dreaded anxiety around ensuring you give the perfect gift to the ones you love.</p></span>
					<p>What if we told you that these complexities could be solved through the automation of inspiration? </p>
					<span>
					<p>We would like to present our project idea. The <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> mobile app will revolutionise the gift buying process and ensure that your affections are always on-point. In essence, the Smarter Gifter app will remind you, the user, of upcoming, programmed special occasions such as a birthdays or anniversaries. The application is built around the profiles of your loved ones and will make targeted recommendations and suggestions based on their interests, age, hobbies, and location.</p>
					</span>
					<p>Using the application will be user friendly and intuitive. Once you have downloaded the app to your preferred smart device, you can easily create a profile of all your nearest and dearest. The creation of a profile is easy, and once created, will only require minimal maintenance.</p>
					<p>The profile will be created based on information such as:</p>
					
					
					<div class="projectContentsRight">
						<ul>
							<li>Name</li>
							<li>Photo </li>
							<li>Date of Birth</li>
							<li>Town/Suburb </li>
							<li>Interests </li>
							<li>Turn Notifications on/off for special days (select from a pre-determined list of special occasions or create your own!). Preloaded days include:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Birthday Day </li>
								<li>Father’s Day </li>
								<li>Mother’s Day </li>
								<li>Variety of culturally appropriate days </li>
								<li>Variety of religious days</li>
								<li>Anniversary.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<p>The easy-to-use set-up will make creating profiles a breeze!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="projectLeftSideHeader">

					</div>
						
					<div class="clear"></div>
					<p>As you see products in the store, or think of gift ideas that would be suitable, you simply update their profile. The application can save online shopping links for the items that you know they will love.</p>
					<p>Still unsure what to get them? No worries! The application will consider their interests, age and location, and make recommendations and suggestions for you based on their profile details. This will give you the opportunity to shop online directly or provide you with the inspiration and get those creative juices flowing. </p>
					<p>As a special occasion draws near, you will receive an automated notification sent directly to your email or mobile, reminding you of the approaching celebration.  </p>
