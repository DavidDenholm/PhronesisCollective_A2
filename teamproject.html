					<h2>The sales pitch</h2>
					</center>
					<span>
					<p>While we settle in for 2022, just the other week Christmas was celebrated. On its lead-up, it was common to hear the usual Christmas script being completed by everyone around. It was like a chorus the echoed in every house, shop, and workplace across the country: 
					<p2>“What do you hope Santa will bring you for Christmas?”</p2></p></span>
					
					<span><p><p2>“I’m not sure”, “I haven’t thought about it”</p2> and <p2>“I don’t need anything”</p2> are all socially acceptable answers.</p></span>
					<p>The patter is as old as Santa Clause himself.</p>
					
					<p>Every year is much the same.</p>
					
					<span><p><p2>‘38% of US consumers say that guessing what people want is their greatest annoyance when shopping for presents’</p2> (Emarsys 2021).</p>
					<p>Such is the issue with the gift giving roulette, that Australian retailer Myer created an entire 2021 advertisement campaign surrounding it. Titled Unriddle Christmas, Myer (2021) explores the dreaded anxiety around ensuring you give the perfect gift to the ones you love.</p></span>
					<p>What if we told you that these complexities could be solved through the automation of inspiration? </p>
					<span>
					<p>We would like to present our project idea. The <b><p2>Smarter Gifter</p2></b> mobile app will revolutionise the gift buying process and ensure that your affections are always on-point. In essence, the Smarter Gifter app will remind you, the user, of upcoming, programmed special occasions such as a birthdays or anniversaries. The application is built around the profiles of your loved ones and will make targeted recommendations and suggestions based on their interests, age, hobbies, and location.</p>
					</span>
					<p>Using the application will be user friendly and intuitive. Once you have downloaded the app to your preferred smart device, you can easily create a profile of all your nearest and dearest. The creation of a profile is easy, and once created, will only require minimal maintenance.</p>
					<p>The profile will be created based on information such as:</p>

					</div>
					
					<div class="projectContentsRight">
						<ul>
							<li>Name</li>
							<li>Photo </li>
							<li>Date of Birth</li>
							<li>Town/Suburb </li>
							<li>Interests </li>
							<li>Turn Notifications on/off for special days (select from a pre-determined list of special occasions or create your own!). Preloaded days include:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Birthday Day </li>
								<li>Father’s Day </li>
								<li>Mother’s Day </li>
								<li>Variety of culturally appropriate days </li>
								<li>Variety of religious days</li>
								<li>Anniversary.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						
					<p>The easy-to-use set-up will make creating profiles a breeze!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="clear"></div>
					<p>As you see products in the store, or think of gift ideas that would be suitable, you simply update their profile. The application can save online shopping links for the items that you know they will love.</p>
					<p>Still unsure what to get them? No worries! The application will consider their interests, age and location, and make recommendations and suggestions for you based on their profile details. This will give you the opportunity to shop online directly or provide you with the inspiration and get those creative juices flowing. </p>
					<p>As a special occasion draws near, you will receive an automated notification sent directly to your email or mobile, reminding you of the approaching celebration. </p>

					<p>As this will be a mobile application, you will not require any new or specialised hardware. You will simply be able to download the app from you chosen app store and start creating profiles for your friends and family immediately!</p>

						<h2>The Technology</h2>
					</center>
					<p>C++ would be the best programming language as it is the primary language used within the mobile industry (EDUCBA 2020). This language, best suited to Android OS, iOS, and Windows, has a high-performance server and is supported by Windows and Mac OS. Many programmers seem well versed in C++, and with some instruction and practice, I anticipate it would be easy to navigate</p>
					<p>For the app development I would be looking at a relevant Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which to write the code. I would consider Xamarin as it is appears to be the most popular integrated environment developed for iOS, Android, and Windows.</p>
					<p>As the app gains traction with users, I could look to purchase personal data through Google. Smarter Gifter could link with members Google accounts and refine gift suggestions based on their algorithms and personalised Google advertisements.</p>
					
					<center>
						<h2>The Funding</h2>
					</center>
					<p>As a new start up mobile app company, funding options are important to consider. We have discussed a few different options for this venture: </p>
					<span><p><b><p2>Premium Subscription – </p2></b>Approaching big retailers such as Westfarmers, eBay, Amazon, etc would be one way to link into sellers and fund our project. One benefit would be a direct link into the market for gift ideas. However, it may be difficult to obtain funding initially as we are a new company.</p></span>
					<span><p><b><p2>In-Store Purchase – </p2></b>One-off in-app store purchase would be an option. We would need to consider if this was right for us, as there are similar (free) items already on the market. While our product is superior to what is out there already, convincing the consumer will be hard without reputation.</p></span>
					<span><p><b><p2>Subscription Service – </p2></b>Much like one off in-store purchase, this is a risky decision. It would require consumers to opt in for an annual fee. While we have no doubt many of our consumers would love it, we believe that it would not appeal to most people.</p></span>
					<span><p><b><p2>Crowd Funding – </p2></b>Historically, Crowd Funding has proven to be generous to new start ups with good designs and ideas. We believe that we tick both boxes.</p>
					
					<center>
						<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
					</center>
					<p>The project will be successful when people start receiving solicited reminders filled with gift ideas and inspirations for their loved ones. This will result in a more excited and highly anticipated Christmas season, and the assurance that the giver is going to provide something meaningful and considerate.</p>
					
					<center>
						<h2>Application Evolution</h2>
					</center>
					<p>In future the app will have the ability to evolve to suit other applications. Its formular is simple:</p>
					<b><h4a>Trigger Event + Online Resources = Outcome</h4a></b>
					<p>The Smarter Gifter concept could be easily adapted for events such as large corporate meetings or for research purposes. As a date or event is achieved, and the app could automatically send through relevant links and information from current newsworthy articles.</p>
