		<h4>What do Blockchains do?</h4>
<p>
Blockchain technology is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system.
</p>
<p>
The technology was first described by Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta in 1990 in How to timestamp a digital document.
</p>
<p>

A Blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the Blockchain. 
Each block contains transactions, each time a new transaction occurs on the Blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to the ledger. 
The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as a Distributed Ledger.

</center>
<p>Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
</p>
<p>
If one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all the distributed versions of the chain. Because of this, it is gaining popularity with companies that want data storage that is impossible to falsify.

</p>
<p>The first Blockchain was Bitcoin, Created 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, two more generations of blockchains have been created, Ethereum and Cardano.

</p>
<p>The first generation blockchains used the premise of a public ledger that supports a crypto currency network. Satoshi’s idea of blockchain made use of 1-megabyte blocks on information. The blocks were linked together through a complex cryptographic verification process, forming an immutable chain. Even in its earliest guises. Blockchain technology set up many of the features which future generation blockchains still use.

</p>
<p>The second generation blockchains introduced smart contracts. The founders of Ethereum had the idea that assets and trust agreements could benefit from blockchain management. This was a major innovation in blockchain technology as they removed the need for oversight by a separate entity as smart contracts became self-managing. The self-triggering protocols are triggered by an event like the passing of an expiration date or the achievement of a particular price goal in which the smart contract adjusts as needed without any outside entities.

</p>
<p>At this point it is still debated if the potential of smart contracts has been fully tapped and if moving on to the next stage of blockchain development is warranted.

</p>
<h4>Issues with Blockchains</h4>
<p>One of blockchains larges issues is scalability. This issue will continue to grow as more people start using blockchains more and more. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have issues with transaction speeds and bottlenecking. Many new blockchains have attempted to accommodate these issues, but with varying degrees of success. In the future one of the most important developments for blockchain will have to do with scalability.
	
</p>								 
<p>Another issue with blockchain technology is the amount of power required. A simple server can operate transactions with very low energy consumption. A typical non blockchain, centralised system will use more complex systems with will use slightly more energy. A public Proof-of-Work blockchain uses approximately 10^9 times more energy.
New applications and developments in blockchain technology and being discovered and implemented constantly.

<h4>What is the likely impact of Blockchains?</h4></p>								 
<p>
One of the likely impacts of blockchains will be in the banking sector. Not only does blockchain technology allow anyone to exchange money faster, more efficiently and more securely, but banks are already working on adopting blockchain technology.
</p>
<p>Cyber security will also become more secure with blockchain technology. Blockchains will allow encrypted data storage making it resistant to hacks and unauthorised changes. Centralised servers can be susceptible to data loss, corruption, human error, and hacks. Using a blockchain would allow data storage in the cloud to be more robust and protected against attacks.


</p>
<p>Communications are already partly automated, using blockchains with smart contracts with prebuilt algorithms is already occurring in the industry. Emails, system alerts and call notifications are some examples of these. Using blockchains would allow bi-directional communications and transactions that can occur more freely in an automated environment and produce an immutable record of those communications. This will greatly improve the safety and reliability of our communication systems.


</p>
<p>Digital identities would allow increased security and reduced fraud or identity theft. It would also allow verification and access to services such as unemployment benefits to become much faster.
Government and health services would benefit from blockchains as all our personal and medical information would be instantly accessible, along with any benefits we may be entitled to without needing to jump through hoops to prove our identity each time we need access to these services.

</p>
<h4>How will Blockchains affect me?</h4>								 
<p>
One of the recent advancements on blockchain technology has been Non-Fungible Tokens. (NFT’s)
</p>
<p>
With the development of NFT’s and blockchains catering specifically to the banking sector, we can expect contracts to be created in NFT form. While NFT’s are currently used for art, these will be a permanent proof of ownership for items or properties permanently located on the blockchain. The NFT contracts will also reduce the need for deforestation due to less paper consumption, however the blockchains need for power consumption will still be an issue for some time to come.

</p>
<p>We currently use passwords and authentication questions to prove who we are online. Blockchain technology could replace this system with a digital identity that is safe, secure, and easy to manage.

</p>
<p>Instead of proving who you are by recalling some personal information that could be guessed or stolen, your digital identity would be a unique set of numbers assigned to each user on the blockchain. This means your identity can’t be hacked or changed without access to your private key.

</p>
<p>Using this sort of digital identity will make Know Your Customer (KYC) verification much faster. Some verification times can take more than a month to complete. Digital identities and smart contracts could make loan requests and verifying identities a lot faster.
