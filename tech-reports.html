					<h4>What do Blockchains do?</h4>
						<p>Blockchain technology is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system.</p>
						<p>The technology was first described by Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta in 1990 in How to timestamp a digital document.</p>
						<p>A Blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the Blockchain. Each block contains transactions, each time a new transaction occurs on the Blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to the ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as a Distributed Ledger.</p>
						<center>
						<img src="DLT.png" alt="DLT"/>
						</center>
						<p>Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.</p>
						<p>If one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all the distributed versions of the chain. Because of this, it is gaining popularity with companies that want data storage that is impossible to falsify.</p>
						<p>The first Blockchain was Bitcoin, Created 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, two more generations of blockchains have been created, Ethereum and Cardano.</p>
						<p>The first generation blockchains used the premise of a public ledger that supports a crypto currency network. Satoshi’s idea of blockchain made use of 1-megabyte blocks on information. The blocks were linked together through a complex cryptographic verification process, forming an immutable chain. Even in its earliest guises. Blockchain technology set up many of the features which future generation blockchains still use.</p>
						<p>The second generation blockchains introduced smart contracts. The founders of Ethereum had the idea that assets and trust agreements could benefit from blockchain management. This was a major innovation in blockchain technology as they removed the need for oversight by a separate entity as smart contracts became self-managing. The self-triggering protocols are triggered by an event like the passing of an expiration date or the achievement of a particular price goal in which the smart contract adjusts as needed without any outside entities.</p>
						<p>At this point it is still debated if the potential of smart contracts has been fully tapped and if moving on to the next stage of blockchain development is warranted.</p>
					<h4>Issues with Blockchains</h4>
						<p>One of blockchains larges issues is scalability. This issue will continue to grow as more people start using blockchains more and more. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have issues with transaction speeds and bottlenecking. Many new blockchains have attempted to accommodate these issues, but with varying degrees of success. In the future one of the most important developments for blockchain will have to do with scalability.</p>								 
						<p>Another issue with blockchain technology is the amount of power required. A simple server can operate transactions with very low energy consumption. A typical non blockchain, centralised system will use more complex systems with will use slightly more energy. A public Proof-of-Work blockchain uses approximately 10^9 times more energy. New applications and developments in blockchain technology and being discovered and implemented constantly.</p>
						<center>
						<img src="PowerChart.png" alt="PowerChart"/>
						</center>
					<h4>What is the likely impact of Blockchains?</h4>								 
						<p>One of the likely impacts of blockchains will be in the banking sector. Not only does blockchain technology allow anyone to exchange money faster, more efficiently and more securely, but banks are already working on adopting blockchain technology.</p>
						<p>Cyber security will also become more secure with blockchain technology. Blockchains will allow encrypted data storage making it resistant to hacks and unauthorised changes. Centralised servers can be susceptible to data loss, corruption, human error, and hacks. Using a blockchain would allow data storage in the cloud to be more robust and protected against attacks.</p>
						<p>Communications are already partly automated, using blockchains with smart contracts with prebuilt algorithms is already occurring in the industry. Emails, system alerts and call notifications are some examples of these. Using blockchains would allow bi-directional communications and transactions that can occur more freely in an automated environment and produce an immutable record of those communications. This will greatly improve the safety and reliability of our communication systems.</p>
						<p>Digital identities would allow increased security and reduced fraud or identity theft. It would also allow verification and access to services such as unemployment benefits to become much faster.
						Government and health services would benefit from blockchains as all our personal and medical information would be instantly accessible, along with any benefits we may be entitled to without needing to jump through hoops to prove our identity each time we need access to these services.</p>
					<h4>How will Blockchains affect me?</h4>								 
						<p>One of the recent advancements on blockchain technology has been Non-Fungible Tokens. (NFT’s)</p>
						<p>With the development of NFT’s and blockchains catering specifically to the banking sector, we can expect contracts to be created in NFT form. While NFT’s are currently used for art, these will be a permanent proof of ownership for items or properties permanently located on the blockchain. The NFT contracts will also reduce the need for deforestation due to less paper consumption, however the blockchains need for power consumption will still be an issue for some time to come.</p>
						<p>We currently use passwords and authentication questions to prove who we are online. Blockchain technology could replace this system with a digital identity that is safe, secure, and easy to manage.</p>
						<p>Instead of proving who you are by recalling some personal information that could be guessed or stolen, your digital identity would be a unique set of numbers assigned to each user on the blockchain. This means your identity can’t be hacked or changed without access to your private key.</p>
						<p>Using this sort of digital identity will make Know Your Customer (KYC) verification much faster. Some verification times can take more than a month to complete. Digital identities and smart contracts could make loan requests and verifying identities a lot faster.</p>

		<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
		</center>
		<div id="techReport">
			<section>
				<article>
					<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence, used by computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The term machine learning was coined by Arthur Samuel, back in 1959, when he created a program that got better at playing checkers the more it played. It has evolved since then to be a part of our everyday lives, even if we don't always see it.</p>
						
					<h4>There are three main types of machine learning.</h4>
					<h4>Supervised learning</h4>
						<p>Supervised learning uses labeled data to train with, and it predicts the output based on that. For example, if you fed the computer 5 photos of dogs, and told the computer that they were photos of dogs. The next time you feed the program a dog photo,it will be able to tell you with accuracy what the photo is. Supervised learning is widely used to do things like predicting house prices based on many different points of data.</p>
					<h4>Unsupervised learning</h4>
						<p>Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and behaviors of objects. Using the above example, if you fed thousands of images of different animals into the training data, a program using unsupervised learning would be able to cluster together all the similar animals into groups. The important difference to note here is that the computer doesn't know the names of the animals or even what the data set is, it is simply recognizing patterns. The most common use for unsupervised learning is in marketing. The ability to recognize sales patterns usingdata like age, gender, income, and education, and finding the common groups and where they spend the most money is very useful for any company. These groups can seem completely random to the human eye, which is why unsupervised learning is invaluable.</p>
					<h4>Reinforcement learning</h4>
						<p>Reinforcement learning is a fascinating branch of machine learning that uses feedback to improve its output over time. If you have ever entered in one of these Captchas below, you have participated in reinforcement learning.</p>
					
					<p>Image recognition is a part of reinforcement learning, but it has a wide variety of other uses. One very important use is in healthcare, where it is used to figure out a treatment plan for a patient based on previous experience.The most common area you will see image recognition every day is in advertisements, where companies such as Facebook will track how much time you spend looking at an ad and adjust what they show you accordingly.</p>
					
					
					<h4>Here are some of the ways machine learning is intertwined in your everyday life:</h4>
					<h4>Content recommendations</h4>
						<p>When you browse a site such as Netflix, eBay, or social media, your feed is completely tailored to you. This is all done using machine learning, to try and keep you entertained for the longest time possible. If you and a friend have identical facebook accounts with the same friends and liked pages, your feeds will still look completely different. This can be a dangerous thing, as it gives social media a degree of power over your emotions and interests. However, it can be very useful, and keep you from seeing irrelevant ads or spam. Facebook has been in legal trouble for ethical problems before, and it almost certainly won't be the last time for this reason.</p>
					<h4>Email spam filter</h4>
						<p>Whenever we receive an email these days it gets automatically flagged and sorted before we can even see it. Based on several machine learning algorithms, your email might be sent to spam, flagged as normal, or flagged as important. This used to be done using keywords to flag an email, eg. If it had the word accounts in it, it would tag it as important. However, with machine learning, emails are sorted using many different variables such as content, sender names, and many more including your own personal email sorting habits.</p>
					
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>As machine learning technologies grow, they have the potential to make many jobs redundant. Computers can already process data at a much higher rate than a human, and with the application of machine learning the programs can use that data to complete a wide variety of tasks.    Kai-Fu Lee, The author of the AI book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order; has even predicted as much as forty percent of the workforce could be replaced with artificial intelligence. Below are a few of the roles that could be most affected.</p>
					<h4>Data entry</h4>
						<p>Many data entry jobs can already be made much quicker with simple python scripts. The human aspect is still usually needed to check for errors before processing, as well as knowing which data is correct to input. With machine learning to control these simple tasks, this job could be completely obsolete.</p>
					<h4>Proofreading</h4>
						<p>Proofreading was once a very large job that is already nearly obsolete due to autocorrect and grammar checking programs. The job is still needed to check for tone, and reading comprehension, but machine learning could become capable of these tasks in the future. For example, IBM's tone analyzer can already predict the tone of text quite accurately. </p>
					<h4>Couriers</h4>
						<p>Driverless cars are becoming more advanced every day, and machine learning is the driving force behind them. In transport companies, machine learning is already used to predict driver's delivery runs, and run reports on which trucks to send to different locations. This hasalready taken over many logistics managers' jobs, and with driverless cars and trucks, the delivery drivers themselves could become obsolete. Many long-distance truck drivers will simply drive to a location, and have a container loaded or unloaded, requiring no work from them other than driving the trucks. As the technology improves there is no reason this couldn't be replaced with machine learning, savings upwards of 100K every year per driver.</p>
					<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>Most of my roles have been in sales or warehousing, both of which could be done in part by machine learning. Warehousing is already automated in many factories, via machine learning and robotics. Sales may seem like a human-specific job, but realistically with the growth of online shopping machine learning is already playing a large part in the role. Customer service bots are also very commonplace nowadays, replacing many sales and support jobs. I am however moving away from these fields to get into the tech industry. Tech and programming jobs will continue to evolve and become vastly more complicated, but due to the nature of the jobs, they will not become obsolete in the foreseeable future.</p>

		<h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h2>
		</center>
		<div id="techReport">
			<section>
				<article>
					<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>Arduino was an open-source hardware project in 2005 in Italy to create simple, low-cost, low power consumption, ready-to-use credit-card size printed circuit boards with cheap ATmega8 microcontrollers for non-engineers to facilitate digital projects [1,2].</p>
						<p>An off-the-shelf microcontroller requires a circuit and other electronic components, such as crystal resistor, to make it functional [1]. These Arduino boards with microcontrollers and other components are collectively referred to as Arduinos, and Arduino Uno is the most commonly known.</p>
						<p>While there was no expensive state-of-the-art technological in its making, it was its clever modular design that Arduinos are ready to be used in flexible ways, yet affordable. Arduinos also require software to operate, and Arduino developed an open-source cross-platform IDE in Java programming language for this [1,2]. Many free software libraries are available [1].</p>
						<p>Arduinos are designed to accept both analogue and digital I/O and are suitable for designs that execute physical tasks, though the power output is limited to a few milliamps and is not powerful to drive a large motor [1]. However, there are printed expansion circuit boards called shields that can stack over the pin headers of Arduino boards to enhance functionality and capability, e.g. motor controls, lights, sensors, wireless/Bluetooth modules to Arduinos [2,3,4]. With all these, Arduino becomes a perfect platform to build robots [4,5].</p>
						<p>Because of Internet of Things, there will likely be in high demand of low power, small and wearable gadgets bearing sensors, attenuators, and reliable device-to-device connectivity modules. It is anticipated that there will be more development of Arduino variants to meet the upcoming demands.</p>
						 
						<p>Deputed in 2012, Makey Makey is a USB-human interface device built on a small single circuit board similar to Arduino Leonardo board. It is an input device using open/closed loop circuit design [6,7]. When the circuit is closed, it sends an output signal equivalent to a spacebar or a mouse click to the computer via USB port and a software to action the signal.</p>
						<p>In 2010, inventors Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum aimed to connect many everyday object as a switch, moving away from keyboard/mouse [6,7]. To achieve this, Makey Makey overcomes the high signal noise by using a pull-up resistor array to sense the low voltage returning from the connected object. It uses alligator clips as connectors, making it extremely customizable in its innovative uses.</p>
						<p>Many developers connect various objects to programs to produce interesting audio and/or visual effects. Its simplistic design also provides a portal for young students to explore electronics, design logics and coding concepts [8,9]. Makey Makey open-sourced its design and used low-cost Atmel 32U4 microcontroller in its earlier version. The latest version is designed around a sound controller GPCE4096UA [6]. Number of Makey Makey boards can be used together, each can take up to 6 key stroke input [9]. Hence, its application to enhance creativity and end-product users’ experiences by more and more artists and designers is likely to happen in the near future.</p>
						<p>Raspberry Pi, or Raspi, looks similar to Arduino and Makey Makey. However, Raspi is more than a microcontroller on a circuit board, but an open-source low-cost barebone modular microprocessor computer on a single motherboard, first released in 2012 in U.K., with its aim to promote basic computer science teaching in schools [10,11]. Raspi runs on linux OS and requires higher power supply (15W) [11].</p>
						<p>Despite its small size, there are many accessories, including hardware attached on top expansion boards, or HAT boards, that can stack over GPIO pins of Raspi boards to improve Raspi’s functionality [11,19], such as cooling fan and NVMe slot. Therefore, combining Raspi and Arduino would be a good interface to control hardware. Recently, Raspi has been used in many ventilators for COVID-19 patients [10,13]. Other commercial products like a portable synthesizer Organelle, a digital camera OTTO and a digital media player Slice incorporate Raspi computers [10].</p>
						<p>The latest model Pi 4 has better CPU and I/O ports, making it suitable to be used to handle graphics and externalized outputs locally yet provides extensive connecting interface to the world. The cloud computing environment allows substantial terminal device hardware optimization to thin clients, where these terminal devices focus on graphical user interface and outputs, local authentication, web browser and cloud access, and support common peripherals like touchscreens, USB ports, and audio-video inputs/outputs. Raspi and similar small computing devices are ideal barebones for thin client terminals in cloud computing.</p>
					<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>The main positive impact is that microprocessor computers and microcontrollers can be so small yet capable for specific tasks, and being open source with intention to drive the cost down opens up many application possibilities. It creates business opportunities in many industries, e.g. education, advertising, and programming courses.</p>
						<p>Putting a full desktop PC for a digital signage is excessive, but these small microcontrollers and microprocessors are perfect for these jobs. Using as industrial controllers and compute module, such as Modberry [10], where the operating environment is tough, developers/engineers can easily adapt to protect these units with suitable casings.</p>
						<p>Many industrial equipment function as handheld wireless computer devices, even for simple tasks such as barcode scanning, to materialize productivity. Indeed, industrial modernization has accelerated with miniaturization, now digitalization and wireless connectivity so to commit cloud computing.</p>
						<p>Technology manufacturers strive for business growth and leadership and shift the demand-supply paradigm into supplier-driven virtuous cycle. They reengineer and redesign small computing devices from portable to wearable, such as from smartphones to smartwatches, for same, if not less, functionalities, and credit cards with magnetic strips to soon coming ewallets. Suppliers drive the consumer-market with perceived needs for a “better” change, because they are smaller, trendier, and connected.</p>
						<p>Some robots like chatbots and waiter bots may replace customer service counters in malls and a few waiters/waitresses in restaurants. Why obsolete the humble paper-roll ticket machine and replace by a digital colour touchscreen wifi-connected ticketing system, when people still have to wait for their turn for services? Maybe one day, when consumers do not accept frequent patches and updates to their latest gadgets as reasonable, people may crave for real human interactions.</p>
					<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>Arduinos and Raspis set cornerstones to thin client terminal devices that certainly improve our user experience. Furthermore, learn and support open source is a key learning lesson, as it makes it possible to learn and build on further. I am very interested in trying out Raspi and Arduino and may come up with some interesting projects together with my Makey Makeys and Leap Motion Controllers.</p>
						<p>In our daily lives, many electronic appliances and cars have ‘computers’ in form of microprocessors in circuit boards inside, though difficult to if they are Arduinos or Raspi. Years ago, my dishwasher and washing machine had to be disposed only because the computer circuit boards inside were burnt and I was told too expensive to fix them.</p>
						<p>I wonder if my Bluetooth earpiece was genetically related to Arduinos. Do the advertising signboard and interactive Directory in my local shopping mall build on Raspi and Arduinos? May be the POS of my favourite coffee shop used Raspi underneath its beautiful touchscreen. My parents’ automatic blood pressure monitor may possibly be designed based on Arduinos, replacing the mercury sphygmomanometer.</p>
						<p>These small computing devices are useful yet discreet and may have already made our lives more convenient. Further dependent on edge and cloud computing by way of Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things will likely see more gadgets build on these and their genetic variants. However, wearing a connected gadgets and traceable may not be very welcoming among my family and myself, for obvious privacy concerns.</p>

		<h2>Robots</h2>
		</center>
		<div id="techReport">
			<section>
				<article>
					<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>Robots are automated machines used to perform specific jobs without any interference from humans or with extraordinarily little interference. To be considered a robot, a device will have an actual physical object to occupy like a body, unit or frame.</p>
					<h4>Five main types of Robots are</h4>
						<p>Pre-Programmed Robots- Preform predetermined basic actions to do a certain task, like- move one part into another part at a precise location and weld to attach around it. The benefit of this is that it reduces labor for humans, robots can last longer, be more precise and more efficient than any human, so using them in manufacturing factories can be massively beneficial to companies who do utilize them. Whilst these robots have been very efficient at most given tasks, they do have their limits. They can’t change their behavior when being used. Being super-efficient at one task is great but pre-programmed robots don’t have the flexibility to multitask in an innovative way and will be stuck in a loop until they are programmed again.</p>
						<p>Humanoid Robots- Minic humans in appearance, voice, motions, and even behavior to an extent. The most famous at the moment is Hanson Robotics’ “Sophia.” Sophia carries out responses similar to a human, for example it can have conversations, walk, reason and was designed to get smarter over time. Some purposes for humanoid robots would be to go places where humans can’t or would have extreme difficulty in surviving, to collect material, collect information, complete tasks and challenges like search and rescue just like we would if we could, but without the threat of loss of life.</p>
						<p>Autonomous Robots- Act independently from humans for a lot of their functioning time, usually in controlled spaces like your house when you are not there or on the road without a driver. Examples would be the Roomba vacuum cleaner which will clean the floors of the environment bumping into barriers and returning after a cleaning cycle. Self-driving cars have become an extremely popular idea and are being tested on private and public roads, but we are some years away from implementing them into our infrastructure.</p>
						<p>Teleoperated Robots- Are controlled remotely but also have some semi-autonomous actions. These can be used in environments like deep sea, space, volcanoes etc as to avoid danger as we don’t have to be in the same location to pilot them. Some examples of teleoperated robots would be NASA’s K10 Robot which is designed to travel on other planets’ surfaces or the NeuroArm which has been used to make neurosurgeries safer, more accurate and some surgeries are now only possible with such technology. NeuroArm works with a robotic arm controlled by a surgeon at a work station using force feedback controllers to create the image and sensation of microsurgery.</p>
						<p>Augmenting Robots- Improve or enable human capabilities by making them stronger, faster, extending reach, seeing more etc. Full body exoskeletons can now detect and react to bio-electrical signals on the skin, that are used to move your muscles, but instead move the limb or part of the exoskeleton.		Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) or another name for a neural interface, are a popular area of research recently. BMIs are now trying to build devices that help people move when their body may not be able to anymore, due to things like paralysis or complete loss of limb. Neurotechnology around the world is making advancements in bionic eyes to assist people who are losing their vision or who are completely blind. Retinal implants are just one way to re-enact vision by being attached to the back of the eye and then transmits information to the optical nerve to tell the brain what it is seeing through a camera built into glasses worn by the person.</p>
						
					<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>Many believe that the more advance robots become, that we will see less job availability in the workforce because there will be less work for humans to be done. Studies like “The Robot Revolution: Managerial and Employment Consequences for Firms.” show robots are affecting the workplace in unforeseen ways- creating more jobs over all (not for managers though) by increasing production of the companies involved and thus having more need for additional workers and having more money to spend on more employees due to reduced costs from the work robots have done.</p>
						<p>Companies who automate will see the number of middle-skilled workers decline, as highly skilled workers and low-skilled workers increase in population, typical because robots are better with basic performance type work due to robots not varying in performance as much as humans. But with that we could see promotions in professional infrastructure fall to a dreadful halt as there won’t be a middle-skilled position to advance to. Given this change there might be an opportunity to change how most companies see the hierarchy of employees' positions, promotion and employment system.</p>
						<p>Household robots have given us time to do more. From automated shopping if your fridge is empty or low on food to cleaning chores, entertaining and educating our children, quick voice activated searches by devices like “Google Homes” we have more time to do additional things that no one else in history has had with their lives. With the exponential growth in modern technologies, we could expect to have even more free time.  </p>
						<p>Some things will become redundant like machine operators, tax accounts, mathematical technicians but eventually we can expect the whole world to be greatly affected by advancements in robotics. Hopefully for the better.</p>
					<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>They motivate me to want to see how far we can develop robotic technology, to discover what we can fantasize about and make into reality, providing a job opportunity.</p>
						<p>Seeing them in supermarkets, shops, online and in my own house means they affect me everywhere I go now. Even when my family goes away camping, to a music festival or to a sporting event we will take a drone or something just to entertain and play with.</p>
						<p>With bionic eyes, limbs, organs and nanobots being more present in the future we could expect to live longer. Be safer with things like exoskeletons (even if it is just reducing workplace injuries). They could provide more security and protection with security drones.</p>
						<p>As a chef, robots have not had a huge effect on my job yet but could well do it in the future. They could assist in food delivery (driverless cars/trucks), location tracking and how we prepare food and store food now but working in a small business I don’t see it at all.</p>
						
						<p>Robotic sports like racing drones or competing in robot wars create a social aspect to integrate diverse types of people.</p>
						<p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) could help us solve issues as common as daily problems or develop world changing ideas.</p>
						<p>Humanoid robots could be nurse droids by the time I am an elderly person, assisting with tasks I cannot do myself anymore and providing me with security and privacy.</p>
